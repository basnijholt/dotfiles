# Word navigation with Alt+b / Alt+f (Emacs-style)
# Configure iTerm2 to send Esc+b/f for Alt+Arrow:
# Preferences → Profiles → Keys → Key Mappings → Add:
#   ⌥← → Send Escape Sequence → b
#   ⌥→ → Send Escape Sequence → f
bind M-b prevword main
bind M-f nextword main

# Alt+Backspace works for chopwordleft (terminals must send Option/Alt as Esc+)
