- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.
- Always run `git status` before using `git add -A` or `git add .` to verify which files will be staged. This prevents accidentally adding unwanted files to your commit.
- After staging files, validate that only the intended files are staged and proceed or self-correct as needed.
- Never amend a commit once it is made. Commit history should remain unchanged to maintain the integrity of the project history.
- Do not run `python`, `python3`, `pip`, or `pip3` directly. Always use `uv run` or `uv sync --all-extras` to ensure the correct virtual environment and dependencies are used for the project.
- Most projects utilize `pre-commit` hooks to automate code formatting and linting.
- Only make the minimal necessary changes to complete your task.
- Avoid making changes that are not directly related to the task at hand.
